#### Description
1. **LazyPRM**: The implementation of the LazyPRM algorithm, which mainly includes several key functions for path search as `OpenList.m`, `CloseList.m`, and `Point.m`.
2. **LocalOBVP**: LocalOBVP uses Optimal Boundary Value Problem to connect Nodes in the path search process, mainly using `SampleOBVP.m`.
3. **map**: store obstacle map.
4. **PolyOpt**: Nonlinear Trajectory Optimization, mainly implemented in `matlatopt.m` using nonlinear iterative optimization.
5. **TrajGener**: Piecewise curve optimization, mainly implemented in `SegPolyTraj.m` for polynomial and Bezier curve optimization.


#### Instructions
First, use `LazyKinoPRM.m` for initial path search. Then, use `matlabopt.m` for trajectory optimization to obtain a continuous and smooth spatio-temporal trajectory.
**Kinodynamic Trajectory Generation**
`mapaddress`: Path of the obstacle map.
`Point_i/Point_f`: Initial point / target point represented as $[x,y,Î¸]$, indicating horizontal displacement and orientation angle.
**Nonlinear Trajectory Optimization**
`seq_start/seq_end`: Starting and ending segment indices for optimization.

#### Postscript
1. The MATLAB code here is the theoretical verification part of our project. This algorithm is applied in practical navigation planning.
